    <div>
        <h4>To Prepare the Sushi Rice</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Use 2¼ cups uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice, 2¼ cups water, and 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) to cook the rice. This yields 6⅔ cups of cooked rice, enough for 10 hosomaki or thin sushi rolls. Please follow my Sushi Rice recipe for step-by-step instructions on how to cook the rice.</li><br>
            <li>Use ⅓ cup rice vinegar (unseasoned), 3 Tbsp sugar, and 1½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt to season the cooked rice as described in my Sushi Rice recipe. Cover the sushi rice with a damp cloth/plastic wrap at all times to prevent drying.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To Prepare the Filling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut both ends of 1 Japanese or Persian cucumber. Cut in half lengthwise, then cut the halves again lengthwise so you now have 4 strips. Remove the seeds with your knife. Then, cut each strip in half lengthwise yet again. You now have 8 strips.</li><br>
            <li>Cut the 7 oz sashimi-grade tuna block lengthwise into ¼- to ½-inch slabs. Then, cut the slabs lengthwise into long strips ¼- to ½-inch thick.</li><br>
            <li>Remove the natto from 1 box natto (fermented soybean) and place in a small bowl. Season with the packet of soy sauce or seasoning that came with the package. Mix everything up and stir several times until it’s slimy and bubbly.</li><br>
            <li>Make finger-dipping vinegar water (tezu) by combining ¼ cup water and 2 tsp rice vinegar (unseasoned) in a small bowl. Apply this water to your fingers and hands to prevent the rice from sticking to them.</li><br>
            <li>Cut 5 sheets nori (dried laver seaweed) in half. Even though it may look it, nori sheets are not perfectly square; therefore, cut the longer side of the rectangle in half. Also, nori gets stale easily, so store the sheets in an airtight bag and take out each piece only when you‘re ready to use it.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To Roll the Sushi</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the sushi mat on a work surface. The bamboo slats should run sideways (horizontally) so you can roll them up. On the mat, place a nori half sheet shiny side down, with its long side along the bottom edge of the mat (the side closest to you). Leave about 3–4 slats visible on the side nearest you.</li><br>
            <li>Moisten your hand with tezu before you touch the sushi rice.</li><br>
            <li>Using a measuring cup, scoop ½ cup (80 g) of sushi rice into your hand. This way, you‘ll use the same the amount of rice for each roll and they will be the same size. You can wet the measuring cup with tezu so the rice won‘t stick. I know, this is not the “proper” way, but until you can grab a perfect amount of rice each time, this trick will do!</li><br>
            <li>Place the sushi rice on the nori, left of center. Leaving a 1-inch strip of nori along the top edge, spread the rice toward the right using your right fingers while you use your left fingers to keep the rice away from the 1-inch nori strip on top.</li><br>
            <li>Spread the rice evenly with both fingers, still keeping the 1-inch space on the top. Wet your fingers in dipping water if the rice starts to stick.</li><br>
            <li>Place a single filling of your choice (tuna, cucumber, or natto) in the middle of the rice across the entire length of the roll. If your tuna or cucumber is too short, add extra pieces on the end. Hold the filling down using your fingers.</li><br>
            <li>Lift up the bottom edge of the sushi mat with your thumbs. With one swift movement, roll the nori and rice over the filling. Land right at the top edge of the rice. You should still see the 1-inch nori space.</li><br>
            <li>Leaving the sushi mat in place, gently shape and tighten the roll with your fingers from outside of the mat. Shape the roll to give it square sides (or keep it round). Finally, lift the sushi mat and rotate the roll once to seal the top edge of nori. Gently squeeze and tighten the roll again through the mat. Your sushi roll is now done. Move the completed roll to a tray or platter and keep it covered with a damp cloth/plastic wrap at all times to prevent drying. Continue rolling the rest of the rolls.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To Serve</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To cut a sushi roll, wet your knife with a damp towel and cut the roll in half first. You should “push, then pull” the knife while cutting through the sushi. Wet the knife again and cut each half roll into 3 pieces. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and sushi ginger (gari). Enjoy!</li>
